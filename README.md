# Build a Food Review website ðŸŒ®ðŸ¥‘

This project was made as a mob programming project during the Technigo bootcamp. In my team we built a website that lists restaurants, reviews and information based on location â€“ in this case seafood restaurants in Lisbon ðŸ˜‹. All data was fetched from the Zomato API. We had a limited time-frame for this project and worked with tight deadlines. We worked in three groups within my team, with different responsibilities. One group worked with the design, one with the filter-functionality and one with the sort-functionality. In the end we merged the different branches before demoing before the other teams. The project was really fun and we really learned to work as a team.
